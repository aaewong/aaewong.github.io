title: Object-Oriented JavaScript

**Object-oriented programming (OOP)** is programming paradigm centred around the concept of objects. Let's look at how we can use OOP concepts like classes, inhertance, and private and public in JavaScript.


##Objects
###What's an Object?
An **object** is a collection of related things. You can think an object as a programming model of something in the real world. They have characteristics (properties) and might be able to do different actions (methods). In **class-based** OOP languages like Java or C++, an object is an instance of a **class**, a blueprint for a type of object.

###Objects in JavaScript
JavaScript comes with a bunch of built-in objects:


- Array
- String
- Number
- Math
- Boolean
- Function (functions are first-class objects in JavaScript!)
- and [others...](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects)

All objects in JavaScript descend from the **Object** prototype. A new object can be created like this:

```javascript
var myObject = {
    stringProperty : 'some string',
    numberProperty : 10,
    functionProperty : function() {
        // code here
    },
    objectProperty : {
        nestedString : 'another string',
        nestedFunction : function () {
            // code here
        }
    }
};
```

This is an example of an **object literal**, a list of comma-separated key-value pairs wrapped in curly braces. Property values can be of any type, even other objects.

An object's properties can be accessed like this:

```javascript
var string = myObject.stringProperty; // dot notation
```

or this:

```javascript
var string2 = myObject['stringProperty']; // bracket notation
```

New properties can be added to an object like this:
```javascript
myObject.newProperty = 'a new property';
```

##Classes, Prototypes, and Inheritance
JavaScript is a **prototype-based** language. This means inheritance is implemented by cloning another object intead of a class. In JavaScript, objects can be modified on the fly by adding new properties or changing existing ones.

###Defining a Class
JavaScript doesn't have a ```class``` statement like Java or C++, but we can define a class by creating a variable and a constructor function:

```javascript
// define a class called 'Person'
var Person = function(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.sayName = function() {
        return this.name;
    };
};
```

####What is "this"?
The ```this``` keyword refers to the current object. When a ```Person``` is instantiated, ```this``` refers to the new object created, and ```name``` and ```sayName`` are assigned to the object.

###Instantiating a Class
Now that a class is defined, we can create some instances of Person:

```javascript
var person1 = new Person('Bob');
var person2 = new Person('Sally');

person1.sayName(); // 'Bob'
person2.sayName(); // 'Sally'
```

Both person1 and person2 get ```name``` and ```sayName``` from Person. ```name``` is set to the string passed to the constructor.

###Prototype
We can define class properties and functions in the constructor or through the class' **prototype**:

```javascript
var Person = function(name) {
    this.name = name;
};

Person.prototype.sayName = function() {
    console.log(this.name);
};

Person.prototype.species = 'human';

var person1 = new Person('Bob');
person1.sayName(); // 'Bob'
console.log(person1.species); // 'human'
```

###Inheritance
Creating a specialized version of another class is called **inheritance**. The child class inherits all the properties from the parent class. Let's extend ```Person``` by creating a ```Worker``` subclass:

```javascript
// A constructor that creates a new Person, with an additional property
var Worker = function(name, occupation) {
    Person.call(this, name); // call the Person constructor
    this.occupation = occupation;
};

// Extending the Person prototype
Worker.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);

// Make sure Worker.prototype has the right constrcutor function.
// Person.prototype.constructor is the Person() function
Worker.prototype.constructor = Worker;

// Override Person's sayName function with new behavior
Worker.prototype.sayName = function() {
    console.log(this.name + ", the " + this.occupation);
};

var person1 = new Person('Bob');
var worker1 = new Worker('Bob', 'Builder');
person1.sayName(); // 'Bob'
worker1.sayName(); // 'Bob, the Builder'
```

In this example, the ```Worker``` class inherits all of ```Person```'s properties. Even though we didn't assign assign a name property in the ```Worker``` constructor, calling the ```Person``` constructor takes care of that and turns the object into new instance of ```Person```. Although ```Worker.sayName()``` was modified, it doesn't affect ```Person.sayName()```; anything changed in the subclass doesn't affect the parent class.

##Public, Privileged, and Private Members
###Public
A **public** member can be read, modified, or deleted from outside the object.

```javascript
var Person = function(name) {
    this.name = name; // this is a public variable
    // this is a public method
    this.introduce = function() {
        console.log("Hi, I'm  " + this.name);
    };
};

// This is also a public method
Person.prototype.sayName = function() {
    console.log(name);
};


var person1 = new Person('Bob');

// Accessing Person's public members
person1.sayName(); // 'Bob'
person1.introduce(); // 'Hi, I'm Bob'
person1.name; // 'Bob'

// Changing person1y can's public members
person1.name = 'Sally';
person1.introduce = function() {
    console.log('Go away!');
};

// Adding new public members on the fly
person1.favouriteColor = 'blue';
```

Prototype methods are also **static**, meaning they can be called with or without an instance of the class:

```javascript
Person.prototype.sayGibberish = function() {
    console.log('a;lskjfew;aoinc');
};
Person.prototype.sayGibberish(); // 'a;lskjfew;aoinc'
```

###Private and Privileged Members
There are some cases where we'd want to prevent outside objects from accessing certain members. Members that only be accessed from inside the object are called **private**. Public methods that can access private methods are called **privileged**.

####Closures
Private methods and properties are made possible by using **closures**. A closure is a function that has a reference to a variable outside it's declartion. Closures *remember* the environment they were created in.

```javascript
var x = 5;
var myFun = function() {
    console.log(x); // 5 
}
```

We can make a private variables by declaring variables with the ```var``` keyword inside a constructor:

```javascript
var Person = function(name, creditCard) {
    this.name = name;
    var creditCard = creditCard; // private member
    // privileged function has access to the private creditCard member
    this.getCreditCardInfo = function() { 
        return creditCard;
    };
    // private function only accessible within the constructor
    var changeCreditCardNum = function(num) {
        creditCard = num;
    }
};

var person1 = new Person('Bob', '12345');
person1.name; // 'Bob'
person1.creditCard; // undefined
person1.getCreditCardInfo; // '12345'
person1.changeCreditCardNum('67890'); // Uncaught TypeError: person1.changeCreditCardNum is not a function(â€¦)
```
