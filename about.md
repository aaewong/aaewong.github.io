## Background

I'm an 4th Year Software Engineering student from The University of British Columbia. I write code and build things. When I'm not in front a computer screen, I enjoy cycling and playing various musical instruments.

## Experience

I'm currently interning as web developer at [SAP](http://www.sap.com/canada/index.html) in Vancouver.

Check me out on [GitHub](https://github.com/aaewong) to see some of the projects I've worked on.
