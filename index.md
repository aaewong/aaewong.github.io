## About Me

Hi. Welcome to my home on the internet. 

I'm a full-stack developer from Vancouver, BC. Currently, I'm finishing my final year of Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia. I love building software and have a keen interest in all things web. 

When I'm not in front of a computer, I like making music and racing through the city streets on my bike.
